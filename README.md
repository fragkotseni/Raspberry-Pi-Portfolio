# Raspberry-Pi-Portfolio

## Raspberry Pi device

The Raspberry Pi is a small yet powerful and cost-effective single-board computer (SBC). It offers wireless internet and Bluetooth connectivity, along with HDMI, USB, and audio ports, similar to a traditional computer. Often used for programming education and hardware development, it is also popular in home automation, robotics, and can serve as a media streamer or web server.

## Component List and their functions:

CPU - ARM processor with integrated graphics. It is the heart of the device which controls the I/O devices and computations.

Micro HDMI Ports - High Definition Multimedia Interface used for transmitting video and digital audtio data from a computer to monitor or digital TV.

GPIO Ports - General Purpose Input Output Ports which allows the user to interface various I/P devices.

Stereo Audio - Audio connector used for connecting audio output devices such as speakers and headphones.

USB Ports - A common port available for various peripheral devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, HDD etc. This model has both 2.0 and 3.0 USB ports.

Micro SD Card Slot - SD card slot which is required for booting the device with an installed and functional operating system.

Ethernet Port - This connector allows the user access to a wirred network, however only available on the model B of Raspberry Pi.

CSI Camera Port - Camera Serial Interface connects the Broadcom processor to the Pi camera.

15-Pin Ribbon Connector - Display Serial Interface (DSI) is used for connecting LCD to Raspberry Pi using 15 15-pin ribbon cables. DSI provides a high-resolution display interface that is specifically used for sending video data.

PoE HAT Header - The PoE HAT allows you to power your Raspberry Pi using Power over Ethernet–enabled networks.

USB-C Power Port - This USB-C port serves primarily as the power input, allowing the device to be powered via a USB-C power adapter.
