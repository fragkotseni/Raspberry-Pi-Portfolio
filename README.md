# Raspberry-Pi-Portfolio

## Raspberry Pi device

The Raspberry Pi is a small yet powerful and cost-effective single-board computer (SBC). It offers wireless internet and Bluetooth connectivity, along with HDMI, USB, and audio ports, similar to a traditional computer. Often used for programming education and hardware development, it is also popular in home automation, robotics, and can serve as a media streamer or web server.

## Component List and their functions:

CPU (ARM Processor with Integrated Graphics) – The core of the device, responsible for processing computations and managing input/output operations.

Micro HDMI Ports – High-Definition Multimedia Interface used to transmit video and digital audio signals from the Raspberry Pi to a monitor or digital TV.

GPIO Header – General-Purpose Input/Output ports that enable users to connect and control various input and output devices.

Audio Jack – A standard audio connector for external audio devices such as speakers and headphones.

USB Ports – Universal ports for connecting peripherals like keyboards, mice, and external storage. This model supports both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0.

Micro SD Card Slot – A slot required for inserting a microSD card that serves as the bootable storage for the Raspberry Pi’s operating system.

Ethernet Port – A wired network port available on the Raspberry Pi Model B, allowing direct internet connectivity.

CSI Camera Port – A Camera Serial Interface that connects the Raspberry Pi’s Broadcom processor to a dedicated Pi camera module.

DSI Display Port – A Display Serial Interface (DSI) designed for connecting LCD screens using a 15-pin ribbon cable, enabling high-resolution video output.

HAT Header – A Power over Ethernet (PoE) HAT connection that allows the Raspberry Pi to be powered through a PoE-enabled network.

USB-C Power Port – The primary power input, used to power the Raspberry Pi via a USB-C power adapter.
